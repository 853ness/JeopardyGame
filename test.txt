:CAT1:ONE GOOD QUESTION

:QUEST1:100:This is what happens when working with the code:\n\n  String new = "text";
:ANSWER1:T:not compile
:ANSWER1:F:assign the string to a variable named new
:ANSWER1:F:issue a warning but still compile
:ANSWER1:F:assign "text", with the quote marks, to variable new
:ANSWERORDER1:randomized
:EXPLANATION1:This is a classic trick question - "new" is a reserved word in Java (used to construct objects). Thus "new" cannot be used for a variable name. Other reserved words that cannot be used as a variable name include: class, if, and public.
